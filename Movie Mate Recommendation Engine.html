								<p>
								A personal project in which I attempt to build a recommendation engine that can match users of movie networking sites based on how similar their move taste is.
								Various options such as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization are explored to determine which method provides the best recommendations.
								The recommender system uses movie ratings from MovieLens users as input data and I also import my own movie ratings to assess the quality of the recommendations.

							<p>
							As a movie fan, I am always looking for new films that will tickle my fancy.
							One good way to do so is by connecting with fellow film buffs on movie-related social networking sites such as Letterboxd or the Dutch website MovieMeter.nl.
							These sites allow you to follow others and see which movies they watch and what they think of them.
							Due to the sheer amount of users these sites have it can get fairly difficult to find the ones with a similar taste to your own.
							Consequently, I started to wonder whether it would be possible to design an algorithm to easily find the users that have a movie taste most similar to yours based on their movie ratings.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							I already have some knowledge on collaborative filtering algorithms, but I aim to develop an understanding of the situation from the ground up.
							Therefore, I drafted a simple table that includes the ratings four hypothetical users of a movie community platform gave to five random movies.
							I use this table shown below to gain some intuition on how to compare and quantify user's taste.
							The ratings that users give to these movies can range from 1 to 5.
							</p>
							

							<table>
								<tr>
									<th></th>
									<th>Harry Potter 1</th>
									<th>Harry Potter 2</th>
									<th>Drive</th>
									<th>Pulp Fiction</th>
									<th>Love Actually</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>User 1</th>
									<td>5</td>
									<td>5</td>
									<td>5</td>
									<td>5</td>
									<td>1</td>
								</tr>	
								<tr>
									<th>User 2</th>
									<td>5</td>
									<td>5</td>
									<td>-</td>
									<td>5</td>
									<td>1</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>User 3</th>
									<td>1</td>
									<td>-</td>
									<td>-</td>
									<td>1</td>
									<td>5</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>User 4</th>
									<td>3</td>
									<td>2</td>
									<td>-</td>
									<td>4</td>
									<td>3</td>
								</tr>								
							</table>
							
							<p>
							In order to be able to compare the taste of these users, it is necessary to either look at only the movies that both users have rated and compare those ratings or to make a taste profile for each user by using the genre and features of the specific movies.
							In this simple example, I did not come up with a list of features for these films and in a lot of real life cases information like this is not readily available. Therefore, I decided to stick to the first method for the time being.
							I purposefully made the ratings of user 1 and user 2 for the movies that they both rated identical, whereas user 3's ratings are directly the opposite.
							This means that the formula I come up with, needs to illustrate that the movie taste of user 1 and 2 is 100% similar, while the taste of user 1 and 3 is 0% similar.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							One approach to compute taste similarity that satisfies these conditions is by using the absolute difference of the ratings between the two users being compared and the sheer number of movies both users rated.
							For example, if we compare user 1 and 2 it becomes apparent that there are 4 movies that the users both rated. Because user 2 did not rate the film Drive, this movie is not taken into account.
							Subsequently, the absolute difference between the ratings of user 1 and 2 equals 0. User 1 and 3 have 3 movies in common (Harry Potter 1, Pulp Fiction and Love Actually), but the absolute difference between their ratings is much higher namely 12 (4 + 4 + 4).
							With these two variables we can create a formula that computes the users' average movie taste similarity per movie they both rated. In order to get a convenient percentage based score, the absolute rating difference can be divided by 4, which is the maximum rating difference, while being divided by the number of movies in common and subtracted by 1 afterwards.
							Formally, this would look like:
							</p>
							
							<p>
							
							$$ Sim_{Ui,Uj} = {1 - {\Sigma_{k=1}^n |Rating_{Ui,Mk} - Rating_{UjMk}|\ / c \over |A|}} $$

								<h2 class="alt"><strong>Student Performance Prediction:<br />
								A Deep Learning Approach</strong></h2>

								<p>In this project I use Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) to predict the performance of Open University students.
									In addition, I compare the performance of the LSTMs with that of traditional machine learning models including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, feed forward neural networks and more.
									I made use of the R programming language for most of the data formatting, while I used Python, in particular the Keras and scikit-learn packages, for modeling and normalization purposes. </p>

								<h2>Introduction</h2>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08small.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>In January 2019, I obtained my master's degree after defending my master's thesis in which I showed that LSTMs can be of value when used to predict student performance compared to more commonly used machine learning models.
								In this project I replicate the research done in said thesis, be it with some modifications. The biggest change being the ability of this project's models to account for students joining the university's courses at different points in time.
								Consequently, the results of this project are better generalizable to educational settings in which students do not all start a course simultaneously, as is for example the case in most Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).</p>
								
							<p>Predicting student performance is one of the most popular streams of research in the field of educational data mining. Being able to accurately predict student performance at an early stage could prove valuable in numerous ways.
								For example, when students that are at risk of failing a course can be identified appropriate measures could be taken to assist these students. Pilot tests of these type of systems have already been conducted at Purdue University with promising results. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254462830_Course_signals_at_Purdue_Using_learning_analytics_to_increase_student_success" target="_blank"><i>(Arnold & Pistilli, 2012)</i></a>
								The implemented systems managed to increase student retention rates as well as improve course grades. In addition, better admission policies could be designed when accurate prediction of student performance is feasible.
								In order to capture these benefits, accurate algorithms are necessary. Considering that deep learning methods are currently the state-of-the-art when it comes to predictive analytics, it is peculiar that so little research that applies deep learning models to student performance prediction has been conducted.
								My thesis (and by extension this project) serve as an attempt to fill that gap in the literature.</p>
								
							<p>Public student data from the <a href="https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset" target="_blank">Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD)</a> is used to compare the student performance prediction prowess of LSTMs and traditional machine learning models including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines,
								logistic regression models, naive Bayes classifiers and feed forward neural networks.</p>

								<h2>Data Understanding</h2>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08small.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>The OULAD is a public dataset which contains anonymized data on roughly 30.000 students over seven distinct courses. The data covers a timespan of two years divided into a maximum of 4 periods (or <i>presentations</i>).
								The four distinct course presentations in this dataset include courses started in February 2013 <i>(2013B)</i> and February 2014 <i>(2014B)</i> as well as courses that started in October 2013 <i>(2013J)</i> and October 2014 <i>(2014J)</i>.
								For each student in those courses, the dataset contains not only student information such as gender, highest education level, age band and region but also information on the clicks of the students in the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) 
								but also data on the assessments that the students took and their assessment scores.</p>
								
								<p>In order to make some visualizations of the data in R, it is first necessary to load the required packages and import the CSV files. I used the dplyr package for data formatting and the ggplot2 package for visualization purposes.</p>
								
							<pre class="prettyprint lang-r"><code>	
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")

# Import public Open University dataset
assessments <- read.csv("assessments.csv")
courses <- read.csv("courses.csv")
studentAssessment <- read.csv("studentAssessment.csv")
studentInfo <- read.csv("studentInfo.csv")
studentRegistration <- read.csv("studentRegistration.csv")
studentVle <- read.csv("studentVle.csv")
vle <- read.csv("vle.csv")
							</code></pre>
							
							<p>Now that the packages and datasets are loaded in, we can make our first graph visualizing the distribution of students over the different course presentations.</p>
							
							<pre class="prettyprint lang-r"><code>	
SD_plot <- ggplot(data = studentInfo, aes(x = code_presentation,            # Create a barchart with the data from the studentInfo dataframe
                                          fill = code_module)) +           
  geom_bar(stat = 'count', position=position_dodge()) +                     # Make sure the height of the bars represents the count of students
  facet_grid(.~code_module) +                                               # Create the bar charts for each course (code_module)
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5),                # Add some visual polish
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),       
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey85"),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", color = NA),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "grey75", colour = NA))+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set2") +
  guides(fill=FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Student Distribution") +                                         # Add plot title
  xlab("Code presentation") +                                               # Add x-label
  ylab("Student count") +                                                   # Add y-label
ggsave(SD_plot, filename = "Student Distribution.png",                      # Export the graph as a .png file
       bg = "transparent", dpi = 600)               
							</code></pre>
							
							<p> The code above generates the figure depicted below. The figure shows that not all the courses are taught in all four periods. Only three out of the seven courses were taught for all four of the course presentations. Their course codes are BBB, DDD and FFF.
								Because those are the three courses with the most data samples, I decided to only make models and keep the data for those three courses. Moreover, I removed all of the students that did not finish the course from the dataset as nothing can be said about their final result in the course.
								Specific drop-out prediction models are better suited to identify the students that will withdraw from the course. The final results of the students are categorized as either "fail", "pass", or "distinction". The models' prediction accuracy are likely to suffer significantly from having three target variable labels instead of two.
								That combined with the notion that the distinction between students that pass or fail a course is likely to be of more importance than that between students that pass or pass with distinction, made me decide to merge the "distinction" and "pass" target labels into one combined "pass" label.</p>

							<pre class="prettyprint lang-r"><code>	
studentInfo <- studentInfo[studentInfo$code_module %in% c("BBB","DDD","FFF"),]    # Only retain students from courses BBB, DDD and FFF in the studentInfo df
studentInfo <- studentInfo[studentInfo$final_result != "Withdrawn",]	          # Remove those students that dropped out
studentVle <- studentVle[studentVle$code_module %in% c("BBB","DDD","FFF"),]       # Only retain students from courses BBB, DDD and FFF in the studentVle df
studentInfo$final_result[studentInfo$final_result == "Distinction"] <- "Pass"     # Turn the "Distinction" final result into "Pass"
							</code></pre>
							
							<p>I ran some tests using backward selection to end up with a selection of variables appropriate to predict whether a student will pass or fail a certain course.
								The performance of the models did not appear to improve beyond the three variables of (1) the amount of times a student clicks in the VLE every day,
								(2) the amount of assessments the student completed every day and (3) the student's average assessment score updated daily.
								However, since it's also possible with the OULAD to break down the clicks in the VLE, it would be interesting to explore the effects of including the categories of resources that students clicked on in the VLE as additional predictors at a later stage.</p>

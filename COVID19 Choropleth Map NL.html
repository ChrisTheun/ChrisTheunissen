								<h2 class="alt"><strong>COVID-19 Choropleth Map of the Netherlands</strong></h2>

								<p>
								In this project, I created <a href = "https://chris95.shinyapps.io/COVID19MapsNL/">an interactive choropleth map</a> displaying the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on the municipalities of the Netherlands over time with the R shiny and leaflet packages.
								The maps can be used to examine the cumulative number of reported cases, hospital admissions, and deceased citizens in the Netherlands from the 13th of March, 2020 until the most current date (last update: 11 January, 2021).
								In addition, the weekly growth rate of COVID-19 cases can be observed.
								The maps are based on a <a href = "https://data.overheid.nl/dataset/11508-covid-19-aantallen-gemeente-cumulatief">public dataset published by the Dutch government</a>.

							</div>
							</br>

							<p>
							Ever since the COVID-19 outbreak unleashed itself upon the world, massive amounts of data have been collected and made public in an attempt to get a better grasp on the phenomenon and combat it as effectively as possible.
							One such way that helps to illustrate the effects of the phenomenon is the use of interactive maps.
							For example, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) published such a <a href = "https://www.rivm.nl/en/coronavirus-map-netherlands-per-municipality">choropleth map</a> which displays the cumulative reported COVID-19 cases per municipality in the Netherlands.
							My aim with this project is to enhance this map with more features and information to help users get a better idea of how COVID-19 has spread over time and the impact it had per municipality.
							Therefore, I built a similar choropleth map from scratch and added a timeslider feature, which makes it possible to study the effects of COVID-19 per day.
							As opposed to a single map that only focuses on the reported cases per municipality, I included more maps displaying not only the reported cases, but also the number of deceased and the weekly growth of the virus per municipality.
							Moreover, hospital admissions per municipality are also displayed on the labels accompanying each municipality.
							</p>

							<div class="imageContainer"><h2>Data Understanding</h2>
							</div>
							</br>

							<p>
							I used the <a href = "https://data.overheid.nl/dataset/11508-covid-19-aantallen-gemeente-cumulatief">"Covid-19 cumulatieve aantallen per gemeente" dataset</a> published by the Dutch government for the information displayed on the maps.
							This dataset includes the cumulative totals of reported coronavirus cases, hospital admissions and deaths per Dutch municipality for each day from March 13th, 2020 until the last daily update which is May 31st at the time of writing.
							Unfortunately, this dataset does only report the cumulative totals and not the number of active cases. Therefore, the maps are purely built on cumulative measures.
							In addition, I used the <a href = "https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/portal.html?_la=nl&_catalog=CBS&tableId=70072ned&_theme=230"> CBS Open data StatLine</a> to retrieve population numbers per municipality necessary to compute reported cases and deaths per 10.000 inhabitants.
							This dataset has been added to <a href = "https://github.com/ChrisTheunissen/COVID-19-Interactive-Choropleth-Map">my GitHub repository</a> together with the project's R code.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							In order to define the municipality borders on the map, I used the <a href = "https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/e1f0dd70abcb4fceabbc43412e43ad4b_0"> 2019 municipality borders shapefile</a> from Esri NL.
							This shapefile is required to generate the choropleth maps.

							</br>
							
							<p>
							For data preparation purposes I used the dplyr and rgdal packages.
							After loading those in, I read the cumilative COVID-19 cases dataset and the municipality population dataset and reformatted a few features to be in the right datatype.
							Other trivial operations are explained in the code section below.
							</p>
							
							<pre class="prettyprint lang-r"><code>

names(Municipalities_df)[9] <- "Population"		
							</code></pre>			
							
							
							<p>
							After merging the COVID-19 and the population datasets, I proceeded with some feature engineering.
							I mainly used the population numbers, total reported cases, hospital admissions and deceased features to compute the cases and deceased per 10.000 inhabitants as well as daily and weekly growth rates for the three main features.
							Finally, I created a popup_info feature whose function is to display the pop up text with additional information whenever the user clicks on a municipality on the interactive map.

							A shiny app consists of two parts, the user interface (UI) and a server function.
							The code for the UI-object below produces a sidebar with a drop-down list in which the user can select which specific map to display as well as a slider with which the user can specify the date.
							The slider also includes an animation feature, which makes it possible for the user to observe how the COVID-19 situation developed over time.
							Aside from the side panel, a main panel is initialized in which the map will be shown.

							<p>
							Some interesting conclusions can be drawn from observing the map.
							The map displaying the COVID-19 cases per 10.000 inhabitants shows that the southern regions of the Netherlands have been hit relatively harder than the northern regions.
							Especially Noord-Brabant, Limburg and the eastern parts of Gelderland have been suffering from a relatively large number of cases per 10.000 inhabitants compared to regions like Groningen and Friesland.
							The map showcasing the number of deceased per 10.000 citizens indicates that a distinct region in Noord-Brabant that includes the municipalities of Bernheze, Meierijstad and Boekel suffered from a disproportionate number of deaths.
							The timeline shows that those regions where among the first to suffer from the COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands.
							This sudden outbreak might have taken the local healthcare institutions by surprise, leading to a higher relative death count.
							By looking at the weekly change map, we can conclude that the spread of the virus has largely been contained.
							Almost all municipalities have experienced a drop in reported COVID-19 case growth. 
							Except for a couple of municipalities the growth rate has been below 20% compared to the cumulative number of cases previous week.
							These observations indicate the government's lockdown measures appear to have been effective. 
							However, a close eye needs to be kept on ongoing growth rates, as the relaxation of measures could rapidly lead to a new spike in COVID-19 cases.
